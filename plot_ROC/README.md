# plot_ROC folder
The plot_ROC folder contains a file: "__ROC_comparison.py__", which performs the comparison among models selected; the comparative ROC curves and all the python results of individual model are sotre din the "__Classification_Results folder__", together with the ROC plot obtained by TMVA.

## ROC_comparison.py
The command-line arguments are used as the names of the models to be processed. An empty list all_fpr is defined to store false positive rates, and all_tpr to store true positive rates for all models. A loop iterates over each provided model name. For each model, the code constructs the file path containing the model's results. Data is read from each file, skipping the first four lines as they typically contain headers or additional information. The subsequent data columns contain false positive rates (`FPR`) and corresponding true positive rates (`TPR`), which are extracted and stored in the fpr and tpr lists, respectively. These lists are then added to the general all_fpr and all_tpr lists. Another loop iterates over all collected ROC curves. For each ROC curve, a plot is generated using matplotlib.pyplot.plot(), with false positive rate on the x-axis and the complement of true positive rate (`1 - TPR`) on the y-axis. Each curve is labeled with the corresponding model name.
